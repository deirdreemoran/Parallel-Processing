In False Sharing, two (or more) cores are writing to variables that live in the same cache line. 
As soon as each one writes to the cache line, it invalidates the contents of the other, 
requiring a time-consuming re-load.  For this project, we avoid false-sharing by implementing
two fixes.  The first fix, project3_fix1.cpp, uses contiguous array padding to ensure that
each individual block starts and ends on a cache boundary.  The second fix, project3_fix2.cpp, uses
a temporary private variable (created in each coreâ€™s stack) so that very little to no cache line 
conflicts occur.

To compile bash script, use:  proj3

Code using Fix 1 padding is located here:   project3_fix1.cpp
Code using Fix 2 private variable is located here:   project3_fix2.cpp

Results using Fix 1 padding are stored in:   project3_fix1_results
Results using Fix 2 private variable are stored in:   project3_fix2_results
