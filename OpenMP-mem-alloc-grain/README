OpenMP N-body Problem:   Examines variations in performance based on static/dynamic and fine/coarse grained parallelism.

Meaning of file names:
	p2_fg_stat.cpp = Fine grained static
	p2_fg_dyn.cpp = Fine grained dynamic
	p2_cg_stat.cpp = Coarse grained static
	p2_cg_dyn.cpp = Coarse grained dynamic

To compile and execute all 4 programs, enter into command line:    	proj2

Results of 4 separate files are stored in:  
	p2_fg_stat_results
	p2_fg_dyn_results
	p2_cg_stat_results
	p2_cg_dyn_results
